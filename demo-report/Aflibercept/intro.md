# About this report

# Introduction

The data in the report is intended to be a resource to guide the development and lead-optimization of a therapeutic protein. These data can be used in a preemptive fashion - for example, in the decision to substitute an exposed residue on the surface that may be prone to the kind of chemical modification that might affect the stability of the protein. They can also be used to assist the troubleshooting of problems that can arise in the course of an clinical development - for example if an therapeutic protein displays stability issues in storage, or unacceptably high levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials. 

There is always a great deal of risk involved in the development of any therapeutic molecule but experience has shown that the kind of data presented in this report is an invaluable tool for mitigating that risk - either by helping to identify potential problems before they occur, or by guiding the troubleshooting of problems that can occur during the therapeutic protein development and lead-optimization.

## History

Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, that are fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 immunoglobulin.

> Aflibercept, sold under the brand names Eylea and Zaltrap, is a medication used to treat wet macular degeneration and metastatic colorectal cancer. It was developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and is approved in the United States and the European Union. - wikipedia

Regeneron commenced clinical testing of aflibercept in cancer in 2001. In 2003, Regeneron signed a major deal with Aventis to develop aflibercept in the field of cancer. In 2004 Regeneron started testing the compound, locally delivered, in proliferative eye diseases, and in 2006 Regeneron and Bayer signed an agreement to develop the eye indications.
