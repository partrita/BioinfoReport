# # 5. Homologous human frameworks
# 
# The humanization of an antibody that was raised in another species is typically one of the major
# steps in its development for clinical use in humans. Given the nature of VDJ recombination6
# novel (non-germline) sequences can occur in the variable regions of the light and heavy chains
# which makes the humanization of the variable regions more challenging. In many therapeutic
# antibodies, any non-human antibody frameworks in the constant regions can be entirely and
# directly substituted with their human homologs. In the variable regions however, especially in
# the CDRs and in the sensitive regions around them that determine their conformations, only a
# partial humanization may be possible, given the requirement to preserve the antibody’s affinity
# for its antigen. For the humanization of antibody variable regions, alternative methods such as7
# CDR grafting and resurfacing are often used, and these methods are also based upon the use
# of sequences from close human homologs.
# 
# When the goal is reducing a clinical antibody’s immunogenicity in patients, humanization and
# the removal of potential T-cell epitopes (deimmunization) are complementary approaches.
# When the humanization of a particular segment of the variable region is impractical, it may be
# possible to reduce the potential immunogenicity of that segment with fewer and/or more
# conservative substitutions that reduce the number and/or strength of the potential T-cell
# epitopes in that segment. For this reason, the data presented in this section and in the previous
# immunogenicity analysis, can be used together in the antibody development process.
# 
# In this section, we present alignments of the light and heavy chains of the antibody with the ten
# closest human homologs from a database of the human antibody germline. In each case, the
# most homologous frameworks from either the heavy chain, or the light chain kappa and lambda
# frameworks, are shown in conjunction with the best matching J regions. These alignments can
# guide the selection of the most promising human frameworks that could be used for the
# humanization of the variable regions, as well as highlighting non-human sequences that are
# potential candidates for deimmunization in the event that their humanization is not practical.
