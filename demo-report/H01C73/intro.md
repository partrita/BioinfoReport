# About this report

# Introduction

The data in the report is intended to be a resource to guide the development and lead-optimization of a therapeutic protein. These data can be used in a preemptive fashion - for example, in the decision to substitute an exposed residue on the surface that may be prone to the kind of chemical modification that might affect the stability of the protein. They can also be used to assist the troubleshooting of problems that can arise in the course of an clinical development - for example if an therapeutic protein displays stability issues in storage, or unacceptably high levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials. 

There is always a great deal of risk involved in the development of any therapeutic molecule but experience has shown that the kind of data presented in this report is an invaluable tool for mitigating that risk - either by helping to identify potential problems before they occur, or by guiding the troubleshooting ofproblems that can occur during the antibody’s development and lead-optimization.

## About

H-01C73 inhibits the growth of cancer cells by targeting all classes of angiogenesis factors (VEGF) (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, Placental Growth Factor) that are overexpressed around cancer cells. H-01C73 is a material with high research difficulty due to its complex protein structure.


Panoros CEO Lim Hye-seong said, “H-01C73 is expected to have excellent efficacy as a treatment for cancer and VEGF-related diseases by itself, and the substance itself has already proven its value as a platform technology.”
