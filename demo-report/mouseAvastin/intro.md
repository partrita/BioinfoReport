# About this report

# Introduction

The data in the report is intended to be a resource to guide the development and lead-optimization of a therapeutic protein. These data can be used in a preemptive fashion - for example, in the decision to substitute an exposed residue on the surface that may be prone to the kind of chemical modification that might affect the stability of the protein. They can also be used to assist the troubleshooting of problems that can arise in the course of an clinical development - for example if an therapeutic protein displays stability issues in storage, or unacceptably high levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials. 

There is always a great deal of risk involved in the development of any therapeutic molecule but experience has shown that the kind of data presented in this report is an invaluable tool for mitigating that risk - either by helping to identify potential problems before they occur, or by guiding the troubleshooting of problems that can occur during the therapeutic protein development and lead-optimization.

## Background

Bevacizumab, sold under the brand name Avastin, is a medication used to treat a number of types of cancers and a specific eye disease. For cancer, it is given by slow injection into a vein (intravenous) and used for colon cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, and renal-cell carcinoma. In many of these diseases it is used as a first-line therapy. For age-related macular degeneration it is given by injection into the eye (intravitreal).

B20-4 is an anti-VEGF antibody, which has previously been used as a surrogate for preclinical modelling of bevacizumab activity.
