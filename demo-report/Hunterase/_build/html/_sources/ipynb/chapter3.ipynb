    "Data describing the solvent-accessible surface of a molecule is of great utility in the\n",
    "development of that molecule as a therapeutic, particularly in the case of antibodies. In the\n",
    "context of this report, the most obvious application of molecular surface data is in combination\n",
    "with the potential sites of chemical modification, described in the previous section. Antibodies\n",
    "(and other proteins) are known to undergo many different chemical modifications as a result of\n",
    "interactions with their aqueous environment. The probability and kinetic rate of such a\n",
    "modification is greatly enhanced by the degree of exposure of the potential modification site to\n",
    "the solvent environment.\n",
    "If a 3D structure was supplied or requested by the client, then the graphs below will show the\n",
    "solvent-accessible surface areas in (Å2) calculated for each residue in the light and heavy chain\n",
    "variable regions of the antibody. These solvent-accessible surfaces are calculated using the\n",
    "“rolling ball” algorithm developed by Shrake & Rupley in which a spherical solvent “probe” is3\n",
    "used, the accessible surface being generated by tracing the center of the probe sphere as it\n",
    "rolls along the van der Waals surface (as shown below).\n",

    "The solvent-accessible surface for each residue depends upon the degree of exposure of the\n",
    "residue on the antibody surface, but also on the size of the residue side chain. Residues that\n",
    "are completely buried within the hydrophobic core of the antibody, will have solvent-accessible\n",
    "surface areas at or close to zero. Residues that are highly exposed at the antibody surface will\n",
    "have values that range from around 100 - 200 Å2, depending upon the size of the residue side\n",
