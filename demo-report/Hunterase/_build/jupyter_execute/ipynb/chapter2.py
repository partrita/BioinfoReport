# # 2. Potential sites of chemical modification
# 
# An initial scan of the antibody sequences is presented based purely upon sequence. If a
# structural analysis was also requested, this section should be used in conjunction with the
# molecular surface analysis described in a subsequent section. Any of the sites listed below
# could be candidates for further consideration if the molecular surface analysis shows that they
# are significantly exposed on the surface of the antibody, increasing their propensity for chemical
# modification. The canonical sequence analysis is also helpful here, since each of these sites
# can also be considered in the context of their frequency of occurrence within the canonical
# library of homologous sequences.
# 
# ## tryptophan and methionine residues in CDRs
# 
# The indole ring of Tryptophan (W) is prone to oxidation, especially when exposed to UV.
# Tryptophan residues in exposed positions in the CDRs, can affect the solubility of an antibody
# and lead to non-specific antigen binding.
# Methionine (M) residues are prone to oxidation through the formation of a sulfoxide, and can
# also become irreversibly oxidized. This oxidation can be accelerated by exposure to metal ions
# (e.g. from the wall of a stainless steel fermentation vessel).
# 

# ## potential deamidation positions
# 
# Asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q) residues are particularly prone to deamidation when they are
# followed in the sequence by amino acids with smaller side chains, that leave the intervening
# peptide group more exposed. Deamidation proceeds much more quickly if the susceptible
# amino acid is followed by a small, flexible residue such as glycine whose low steric hindrance
# leaves the peptide group open for attack.

# Search patterns: ASN/GLN-ALA/GLY/SER/THR

# ## potential o-linked glycosylation sites
# 
# The O-linked glycosylation of serine and threonine residues seems to be particularly sensitive to
# the presence of one or more proline residues in their vicinity in the sequence, particularly in the2
# -1 and +3 positions.

# 
# Search patterns: PRO-SER/THR, SER/THR-X-X-PRO

# ## potential n-linked glycosylation sites
# Search patterns: ASN-X-SER/THR
