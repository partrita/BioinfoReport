# About this report

The data in the report is intended to be a resource to guide the development and lead-optimization of a clinical antibody. These data can be used in a preemptive fashion - for example, in the decision to substitute an exposed residue on the antibody surface that may be prone to the kind of chemical modification that might affect the stability of the antibody. They can also be used to assist the troubleshooting of problems that can arise in the course of an antibody’s clinical development - for example if an antibody displays stability issues in storage, or unacceptably high levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials. There is always a great deal of risk involved in the development of any therapeutic molecule but experience has shown that the kind of data presented in this report is an invaluable tool for mitigating that risk - either by helping to identify potential problems before they occur, or by guiding the troubleshooting ofproblems that can occur during the antibody’s development and lead-optimization.

# Introduction

This report contains a structure and sequence-based analysis of HUNTERASE. Hunterase® is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II, MPS II). Since 2012, Hunterase® has been made available in more than ten countries worldwide. The established efficacy and safety of Hunterase® provide a unique treatment option to patients with MPS II.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome)

Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) or Hunter syndrome, is a rare, disabling, and often fatal genetic disease, which has been listed on the First National List of Rare Diseases (CRDL) published by the Chinese government1.

 

The syndrome is caused by the absence or deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), which is required for the degradation of two glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. In MPS II, GAGs progressively accumulate throughout the body, causing a variety of disease manifestations and leading to tissue dysfunction, organ failure, and reduced life expectancy. The clinical spectrum of MPS II ranges from a severe form with onset in late infancy to early childhood, manifesting severe somatic disease and central nervous system degeneration, to an attenuated form with onset in mid to late childhood, manifesting less severe somatic disease with mild or no central nervous system involvement.

 

The main clinical manifestations of MPS II are developmental delay, short stature, coarse facies, multiple skeletal deformities (osteogenesis multiplex), joint contractures, hernias, hepatosplenomegaly, hearing loss, valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease, and frequent respiratory infections. Patients with the severe form may live for up to 10 years to 20 years2, whereas those with the attenuated form often live into mid-adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy is the standard treatment of MPS II and treatment of symptoms is also required.

 
MPS II is an X-linked disorder that affects males almost exclusively. The incidence of MPS II is estimated to be higher in East Asian countries (1/51,000-1/93,000 live births in Taiwan3,4) than in predominantly Caucasian countries (1/149,000-1/162,000 live births5,6).
